Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

Initial solution ~

def square_sum(numbers):
    pos = 0
    ans = 0
    for num in numbers:
        numbers[pos] = num**2
        pos += 1
    for num in numbers:
        ans += num 
    return ans
